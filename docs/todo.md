In the `presentation_controller.py`:

Add a **keyboard listener** to allow manual section control, improving startup usability when waiting for the warm-up phase (`window size = 12`) and mid-control adjustments. The listener must let the user override section navigation or pause/resume listening without interfering with automatic operations.

### Requirements

1. **Keyboard Listener Functionality**

   - **Right Arrow (`→`)**: Move to the **next section**. Update section index only. Do **not** trigger keypress events via Key Controller. Automatic control logic should continue using this new section index.
   - **Left Arrow (`←`)**: Move to the **previous section**. Update section index only. Do **not** trigger keypress events via Key Controller. Automatic control logic should continue using this new section index.
   - **Space (`␣`)**: Toggle **pause/resume** of the listener.

     - When paused: ignore controlling inputs (other than arrow keys).
     - Do not clear buffers, states, or recent words.
     - When resumed: continue listening from the same state.

   **Special Rule:** Right and Left arrow keys must **always remain active**, even while paused.

2. **Status Messages**

   - Print clear indicators to standard output whenever state changes:

     - `"\n[Paused]"` when paused.
     - `"\n[Resumed]"` when resumed.
     - `"\n[Next Section]"` when moving forward.
     - `"\n[Previous Section]"` when moving backward.

3. **Code Quality Constraints**

   - Refactor for **clarity and conciseness**.
   - Follow **KISS**, **DRY**, and **YAGNI** principles.
   - Eliminate redundant comments and long docstrings; code should be mostly self-explanatory.
   - Ensure manual overrides integrate cleanly with existing logic (automatic slide/section progression must remain intact).

### Outcome

- Startup feels more responsive by allowing manual intervention during warm-up.
- User can directly adjust section index or toggle pause/resume.
- Arrow keys always function, even during pause.
- Console feedback provides immediate awareness of current state.
- Codebase remains clean, minimal, and maintainable.
